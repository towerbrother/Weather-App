## React-Weather-App

A weather App build with React Javascript library fetching current and forecast data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

App deployed with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) at https://towerbrother.github.io/weather-app/

## Motivation

The App has been build as learning opportunity during my path to become a Software Engineer (self-taught). It is the very first App I built as part of the journey.
