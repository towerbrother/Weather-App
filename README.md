## React-Weather-App

A weather App build with React Javascript library fetching current and forecast data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

App deployed with [gh-pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) at [https://towerbrother.github.io/weather-app/]https://towerbrother.github.io/weather-app/

## Motivation

The App has been build as learning opportunity during my path to become a Software Engineer (self-taught). It is the very first App I built as part of the journey.

## Tech/framework used

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built using the following technologies:

- React
- Javascript
- CSS

## Features

The App allows users to fetch current data as well as forecast data for the 5 days following the day the request is made.

The App allows temperatures to be shown in metric as well as imperial unit measure system.

The App is fully responsive and it ensures a pleasant UX in mobile as well as using desktop devices. Some of the information disappear when resizing.

## API Reference

Data fetched using [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) with a free account.

## Credits

I have been receiving a lot of support and motivation from the Codecademy London (UK) Meetup group, in particular from [Giacomo Sorbi](https://github.com/GiacomoSorbi) to whom I am particularly thankful. Grazie! :grinning:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
